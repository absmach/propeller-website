title: Proxy Service
description: Service for fetching and distributing WebAssembly modules from OCI registries
---

The Proxy Service acts as a bridge between MQTT and HTTP protocols in the Propeller system. It enables bidirectional communication between MQTT clients and HTTP endpoints, allowing for seamless integration of different protocols. The proxy service is responsible for fetching WebAssembly modules from an OCI-compliant registry, chunking them, and publishing them over MQTT for `proplet` instances to consume.

## Overview

The proxy service performs two main functions:

1. Subscribes to MQTT topics and forwards messages to HTTP endpoints
2. Streams data between MQTT and HTTP protocols

## Usage

To use the proxy service, you need to set the required environment variables and run the `main.go` file in the `cmd/proxy` directory.

```bash
PROXY_REGISTRY_URL="docker.io"
PROXY_AUTHENTICATE="TRUE"
PROXY_REGISTRY_USERNAME="docker_username"
PROXY_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="docker_password"
propeller-proxy
```

This will change the task definition. Since we are using hosted wasm modules, we need to specify the image URL. Hence the task definition will look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "add",
  "inputs": [10, 20],
  "image_url": "docker.io/mrstevenyaga/add.wasm"
}
```

### How It Works

The proxy service facilitates the download of WebAssembly (WASM) containers through a multi-step process:

![Proxy Service Architecture](images/proxy.png)

1. **Initial Request**
   The proplet sends a download request via the MQTT topic: `m/:domain_id/c/:channel_id/messages/registry/proplet`
   This request is received by the proxy service's MQTT subscriber

2. **OCI Registry Download**
   The HTTP side of the proxy service receives this request
   It then sends a download request to the OCI registry to fetch the WASM container
   The container is downloaded as an OCI image

3. **Chunked Data Transfer**
   Once downloaded, the WASM image is split into chunks
   These chunks are sent back to the proplet via the MQTT topic: `m/:domain_id/c/:channel_id/messages/registry/server`
   This chunked approach ensures efficient handling of large WASM files

### Architecture Details

#### Streaming System

The proxy service implements a concurrent streaming architecture with two main components:

1. **HTTP Stream**
   Handles container fetching from the OCI registry.
   Splits containers into configurable chunk sizes
   Forwards chunks to the MQTT stream via an internal channel.
   Implements context-based cancellation for graceful shutdown.

2. **MQTT Stream**
   Receives chunks from the HTTP stream.
   Publishes chunks to MQTT topics.
   Tracks chunk delivery progress.
   Maintains a map of container chunks to ensure complete delivery.

#### Chunk Management

- Uses a buffered channel system with a capacity of 10 chunks
- Tracks the progress of chunk delivery for each container
- Provides completion notifications when all chunks are successfully sent
- Automatically cleans up tracking data after successful delivery

#### Performance Features

- **Buffered Operations**: Implements chunk buffering to optimize memory usage and transfer speed
- **Concurrent Processing**: Separate goroutines for HTTP and MQTT operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time tracking of chunk delivery status
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of completed transfers

## Configuration

The proxy service is configured using environment variables.

### Environment Variables

### Example Configuration

Export the required environment variables in your terminal:

```bash
# Registry Configuration
export PROXY_REGISTRY_URL="<registry_url>"
export PROXY_AUTHENTICATE="TRUE"
export PROXY_REGISTRY_USERNAME="<your_docker_username>"
export PROXY_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="<your_docker_password>"

# MQTT Configuration
export PROPLET_THING_KEY="<secret>"
export PROPLET_THING_ID="<proplet_id>"
export PROPLET_CHANNEL_ID="<channel_id>"
```

### Authentication

If your registry requires authentication, you can set the `PROXY_AUTHENTICATE` environment variable to `true` and provide either a token or a username and password.

#### Token Authentication

```bash
export PROXY_AUTHENTICATE="true"
export PROXY_REGISTRY_TOKEN="your_token"
```

#### Username/Password Authentication

```bash
export PROXY_AUTHENTICATE="true"
export PROXY_REGISTRY_USERNAME="your_username"
export PROXY_REGISTRY_PASSWORD="your_password"
```

## Running the Service

After exporting the environment variables, you can run the proxy service as shown:

```bash
make all && make install
propeller-proxy
```

This will install the binary in your GOBIN directory (ensure your GOBIN is configured correctly).

## Deploying a Local OCI Registry

Propeller supports pulling Wasm modules from any OCI-compliant registry. You can use a public registry like Docker Hub or set up your own private registry. You can deploy your own OCI registry using Docker and configure the proxy to pull WASM modules from it. This is useful for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Run a Local Registry

First, run a local OCI registry using the official Docker image:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:3.0.0
```

This command will start a local registry in detached mode and map port 5000 on your host to port 5000 on the container.

### 2. Push a WASM Module to the Local Registry

Next, you need to push a WASM module to your local registry. You can use a tool like `oras` or `wasm-to-oci` to do this. First, create WASM module. We can use the `addition.wasm` module from the [propeller](https://github.com/absmach/propeller/tree/main/examples/addition) example after building the wasm module.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/absmach/propeller.git
cd propeller
make all
```

Now, push the `addition.wasm` file to your local registry using `wasm-to-oci`:

```bash
wasm-to-oci push ./build/addition.wasm localhost:5000/rodneydav/addition.wasm
wasm-to-oci push ./build/addition.wasm docker.io/rodneydav/addition.wasm
```

### 3. Configure the Proxy

Finally, configure the proxy to use your local registry by setting the following environment variables:

```bash
export PROXY_REGISTRY_URL="localhost:5000"
export PROXY_AUTHENTICATE="false"  # No authentication for local registry
```

Now, when you run the proxy, it will pull the `addition.wasm` module from your local registry when a request for `localhost:5000/addition` is made.

## Service Flow

1. **Initialization**
   Loads configuration from environment variables.
   Sets up logging with structured logging support.
   Creates a new proxy service instance.
   Initializes MQTT client and communication channels.

2. **Connection**
   Establishes connection to the MQTT broker.
   Subscribes to configured topics.
   Sets up HTTP streaming with the registry.
   Initializes chunk buffering system.

3. **Operation**
   Runs two concurrent streams:
   - StreamHTTP: Handles HTTP communication with the OCI registry.
   - StreamMQTT: Handles MQTT communication for proplet requests and responses.

   Uses error groups for graceful error handling and shutdown. Maintains chunk delivery tracking. Provides real-time progress logging.

4. **Error Handling**
   Implements comprehensive error logging with context. Graceful shutdown with proper resource cleanup. Automatic disconnection from MQTT broker on service termination. Retry mechanisms for failed operations. Context-based cancellation support.

## HTTP Registry Operations

The HTTP configuration supports:

- Registry operations with optional authentication (username/password or token)
- Automatic retry mechanism for failed requests
- Chunked data handling with configurable chunk size (512KB default)
- Static credential caching for authenticated requests
- Progress tracking for multi-chunk transfers
